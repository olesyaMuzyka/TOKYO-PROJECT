                <h4>Hana Biyori Starbucks</h4>
                <p>
                  Tokyo‚Äôs newest Starbucks outlet has finally opened inside the
                  Hana Biyori greenhouse, which is part of a larger garden
                  managed by the popular amusement park, Yomiuriland. Especially
                  during the rainy season, when the weather is unpredictable and
                  sudden downpours are not uncommon, this new cafeÃÅ is a great
                  place to enjoy greenery over a cup of coffee while keeping
                  dry.

                <p>
                  The open, light-filled space is a breath of fresh air. The
                  lush, comfortable atmosphere has plenty of greenery to calm
                  your mind. It's like walking into a floral fantasy of your
                  dreams.

                  Missing grandma's apple pie? The next best thing can be found
                  at Granny Smith's, located just a few minutes from Omotesando
                  Station. The classic menu includes Dutch Crumble, Classic Rum
                  Raisin, French D'mandes and English Custard, while the
                  seasonal pies (yes to sakura!) are equally mouth-watering.
                  Their Aoyama shop also has an eat-in space, a sparse food menu
                  and decent espresso.

                  This is a cute, cozy little caf√© where you can enjoy different
                  varieties of apple pie with coffee, tea, juices, etc. They do
                  take out orders and you can buy whole pies or individual
                  slices.
